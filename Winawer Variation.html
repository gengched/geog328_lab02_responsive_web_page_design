        Here is the Winawer Variation:
        <img src="https://www.chess.com/share/opening/default/French-Defense-Winawer-Variation" style="width: auto; height: auto;">
        <br>
        The following book moves are 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bc3 6.bc Ne7.
        <br>
        <br>
        The white will get doubled pawns as a weak point in exchange for the black having difficulty defending the kingside (due to the absence of dark-squared bishop).
        <br>
        <br>
        There are two variations after 6...Ne7: 7.Qg4 and 7.a4. Against 7.Qg4, I like 7....Ng6 here rather than the normal book move 7....Qc7 (since I don't want to trade my black pawn at g7 with the white pawn at c3). Against 7.a4, I prefer 7....Qa5, followed by c4, Bd7, Nd7-b6 to attack the white pawn at a4
